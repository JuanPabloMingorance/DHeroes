          <p>Margaret Elaine Heafield was born August 17, 1936, in Paoli, Indiana, to Kenneth Heafield and Ruth Esther Heafield (n√©e Partington);[2][3] she has two younger siblings: David[4][5] and Kathryn.[6] The family later moved to Michigan,[7] where Margaret graduated from Hancock High School in 1954.[2] She studied mathematics at the University of Michigan in 1955 before transferring to Earlham College where her mother was a student;[8][9] she earned a BA in mathematics with a minor in philosophy in 1958.[8][10] She cites Florence Long, the head of the math department at Earlham, as helping with her desire to pursue abstract mathematics and become a mathematics professor.[11] She had other inspirations including her father (a philosopher and poet), and her grandfather (a school headmaster and Quaker minister). She says these men inspired her to include a minor in philosophy in her studies.[12]</p>
